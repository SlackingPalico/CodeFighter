#Js Derby: leading the revolution of code racing!

It's an app where a user competes with another user on who can finish solving the test question first. The primary goal is to get new developers to be comfortable with javascript while at the same time trying to make coding fun.

##Motivation and Objectives:

Our goal was to create a better coding experience for everyone that is new to coding.

We wanted it to be fun and innovative.

At the same time, we wanted to try technologies that we never used before.
